The hate speech detection program is designed to identify and flag instances of hate speech in textual data. The program is built using a voting classifier that combines the output of different machine learning algorithms, including BERT, to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

To improve the quality of the training data, two different datasets have been merged. The first dataset was small, and the second dataset was larger, which helps to improve the overall performance of the program.

To ensure the data is properly processed before training, the program uses Porter stemmer and lemmatization techniques. These methods help to reduce the dimensionality of the input data by grouping together words with similar meanings, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of the program.

The program also removes stop words, which are common words that add little value to the meaning of the text. This helps to focus the analysis on the words and phrases that are most relevant to identifying hate speech.

Overall, the program is designed to provide an effective and accurate way to detect hate speech in textual data, which can help to prevent harmful speech from spreading and protect individuals and communities from the harmful effects of hate speech.
